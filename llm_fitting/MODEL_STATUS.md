# Rank-Diffusion Model — Status & Locked-In Results

_Canonical record of the validated FB / Reddit results and the model as written in code._
_Last updated: 2026-07-02 (top-coverage universe; supersedes parts of §2 — see §2b)._

## 1. Unified model (one structure, platform-specific parameters)

Observed log-activity of endpoint *i* at week *t*:

```
X_it = h_it + ξ_it + ε_it
  h_it = ρ_perm · h_i,t-1 + η_it      permanent "home" (level)   η ~ N(0, σ_perm²)
  ξ_it = φ · ξ_i,t-1     + ν_it       transitory activity (AR1)   ν ~ N(0, σ_trans²)
  ε_it ~ N(0, σ_obs²)                 iid measurement noise
```
- **Rank** each week by the *observed* `X = h + ξ + ε`.
- **Gabaix rebirth** at the bottom: rank-dependent exit; re-entry near the lower tail (keeps the
  distribution stationary, reproduces bottom churn).
- **Common factor** removed by per-period de-meaning (platform-wide moves preserve relative ranks).
- **Rank-dependence**: `(ρ_perm, σ_perm, φ, σ_trans, σ_obs)` vary by **permanent-rank band**
  (each entity binned by its *time-averaged* rank — Lagrangian, immune to current-rank selection bias).
- `ρ_perm = 1` ⇒ random-walk home; `ρ_perm < 1` ⇒ persistent reverting home; `σ_perm = 0` ⇒ fixed home.
  Empirically **fixed home ≈ slowly-drifting home over these horizons** — use the simpler fixed home;
  evolving home is a long-horizon refinement, not required for the current windows.

This is one generative law. FB and Reddit differ in **parameters and measurement regime, not theory**.

## 2. Locked-in results

| | Facebook (T=88) | Reddit (T=30) |
|---|---|---|
| In-sample goal-1 (15-metric) | **15/15** (Kalman params, ρ_perm≈0.90) | 13–14/15 |
| In-sample goal-2 churn error | **0.046** | 0.05 (obs_frac=0) / 0.10 (default) |
| **OOS movement** (rolling-origin, distributional) | **NOT yet robust** — see below | worse (T=30) |
| home-drift evidence (Kalman LR drift>fixed) | strong (213–594) | weak-but-consistent (6–63) |

**OOS movement is the acceptance gate** — now **rolling-origin + distributional** (`--oos`):
≥5 train/test splits; per split estimate the variance partition on TRAIN, calibrate one
`sigma_obs_scale` on the TRAIN **moment vector** (dRank1, dRank4, coll1, coll5, RACF1), then
predict the held-out displacement **distribution** (median, p90, Wasserstein, bootstrap-CI coverage).

**Honest FB verdict (5 splits):** the model does **NOT yet robustly pass**. Model rel err
**0.29 ± 0.16** vs persistence **0.15 ± 0.02**; `sigma_obs_scale` is **unstable across windows
(0.15–0.35, median 0.25)**; bootstrap-CI coverage only ~40% of splits; the model **under-disperses
the displacement tail** (p90). It **improves with more training data** (Wasserstein 38→17 across
origins; later splits land in-CI) — pointing to longer panels. A single 67/33 split gave a
flattering 0.081 ≈ 0.070; that was the best split, not the typical one. **Do not report single-split
numbers.**

### Observation noise (the central open problem)
`σ_obs` is the lever on observed rank movement; the pooled change-autocovariance over-states it
~2× for clean top entities, and **calibrating it on training displacement is not stable enough
across windows** to call the gate passed. Status: **calibrated, NOT yet identified.** The decisive
next step is to **identify σ_obs from an independent signal** (daily-within-week residual variance —
noise floor only, not a daily dynamics model; later, replicate measures) and report it as a second
specification (Spec B) alongside the train-calibrated one (Spec A); if B ≈ A's scale, the
observation model is validated. Then re-run this rolling-origin distributional gate.

## 2b. 2026-07-02 — Top-coverage universe (Reddit tractable end-to-end; estimand sharpened)

**Motivation.** The estimand is the macro distribution of attention; Reddit's uncapped panel
(~200k subreddits/wk) is dominated by a measurement-degenerate tail: 60% of the panel has weekly
karma ≤ 5; at rank 50k there are 620-way ties, at rank 100k 10,640-way ties. Tail "rank movement"
is tie-breaking noise. FB's CrowdTangle panel is top-truncated at source (~14.4k pages/wk), so the
uncapped Reddit panel was also a hidden cross-platform asymmetry. Full analysis + concentration
and boundary-flux tables: research_notes.md §3 ("Reddit / FB top-coverage universe").

**Design (in `minimal_rankdiff.restrict_universe`; tests in `tests/test_universe_restriction.py`).**
- Pre-registered coverage rule (`COVERAGE_K`, from concentration stats alone): Reddit K₈₀=2,500
  (80.0% of weekly karma), K₉₀=5,000 (89.2%), K₉₅=10,000 (95.6%); FB K₉₀=3,500.
- Closed Lagrangian universe: the B=4K entities with the best ABSENCE-PENALIZED permanent rank
  (absent weeks at the observation floor N_t+1). Buffer multiple 4 from the empirical excursion
  depth (p99 of drop-landings ≈ 4K). Membership computed on the TRAIN window only inside the OOS
  gate (`member_window=T0`). All member observations retained (no censoring — 99.93% of top-K
  droppers remain observed in the full panel); weekly ranks recomputed within the universe.
- Quantified losses: true weekly disappearance 0.07%; top-K entrants from unobserved 0.4–0.7%;
  train-defined closed set covers 97–98% of future weekly top-K at B=4K.
- Boundary flux is a TESTED PREDICTION: new scorecard rows outfluxK (weekly out-rate from top-K)
  and return4K (4-wk dropper return), computed identically for empirical and simulated ids.
- Estimand-faithful scoring: goal-1 metrics on tracked entities with time-mean rank ≤ K only
  (emp and sim identically); persistence-set size = 1% of K, not of the buffer.

**Corrected pitfall (locked by test):** universe membership by observed-week mean rank re-admits
Eulerian selection — 1–2-week spikers entered, pooled alone in the deepest knot, inflating its
exit rate to 0.60/wk (true: 0.0007/wk) → runaway diffusion (reddit K=2500 scored 4/15, sim dRank1
80.6 vs emp 13). The absence penalty fixes this at the membership stage.

**In-sample results (5 reps; knob settings declared per row):**

| run | obs_frac | goal-1 | churn err | boundary flux (emp→sim) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reddit uncapped (baseline) | 0.4 | 13/15 | 0.151 | — |
| Reddit K=2,500 B=10k | 0.4 | 10/15 | 0.140 | out 0.099→0.113, ret 0.350→0.383 |
| Reddit K=5,000 B=20k | 0.4 | 11/15 | 0.123 | out 0.095→0.114, ret 0.369→0.391 |
| Reddit K=5,000 B=20k | 0.0 | 12/15 | **0.069** | out 0.095→0.113, ret 0.369→0.391 |
| Reddit K=10,000 B=40k | 0.4 | 12/15 | 0.167 | out 0.092→0.110, ret 0.392→0.400 |
| FB full panel (non-regression) | 0.4 | **14/15** | **0.013** | — |
| FB K=3,500 B=14k | 0.4 | 9/15 | 0.016 | out 0.173→0.131, ret 0.354→0.410 |
| FB K=3,500 B=14k | 0.0 | 9/15 | 0.018 | out 0.173→0.130, ret 0.354→0.408 |

Buffer invariance at Reddit K=5,000 (B ∈ {2K, 4K, 8K}): goal-1 11/11/10; RACF1_sim
0.464/0.467/0.463 and boundary flux invariant; coll1_sim (0.68–0.87) and dRank1_sim (17–23) show
residual B-sensitivity traceable to unstable 1–2-entity head knots (head σ_obs estimate swings
2.03 vs 0.46 across universes) — see "what the universe surfaced" below.

**OOS movement gate (rolling-origin, distributional; σ_obs grid extended to 0.0 after Reddit
pinned at the old 0.15 grid edge):**

| platform | model rel err | persistence | scale by split | CI coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reddit K=2,500 | 0.302 ± 0.105 | 0.171 ± 0.004 | 0.0–0.10 | 0% (1 split beats persistence) |
| Reddit K=5,000 | 0.336 ± 0.055 | 0.168 ± 0.004 | 0.0 ×5 | 0% |
| Reddit K=10,000 | 0.389 ± 0.033 | 0.167 ± 0.004 | 0.0–0.10 | 0% |
| FB full (reference, new grid) | 0.276 ± 0.146 | 0.146 ± 0.022 | 0.0–0.35 | 40% |

Note the in-sample/OOS scissors across K: the aggregate in-sample score IMPROVES with deeper K
(10 → 11 → 12 of 15) while OOS movement WORSENS monotonically (0.302 → 0.336 → 0.389) — the
in-sample card is diluted by the broader population while the OOS cohort stays pinned on the
head, where the over-dispersion lives. This is the single-split/in-sample-overclaim pitfall in
miniature and is why the OOS gate remains the acceptance criterion.

The Reddit gate previously HUNG (full-N cohort sim); it now runs end-to-end in minutes. Reddit is
no longer categorically worse than FB — same regime, same failure signature.

**What the universe surfaced (the honest headline).** Scored on the estimand population, both
platforms show one coherent failure: the model over-disperses the head — sim RACF1 ~0.09–0.15 too
low, top-rank collisions and dRank over-predicted, OOS displacement over-predicted even at
calibrated scale 0.0. Setting obs_frac 0.4→0 barely moves RACF1 (0.467→0.476): the excess head
mixing lives in the estimated variance partition itself, not the iid/AR split. The previous
"13–14/15" scores averaged this away over the mid/tail population. Priority unchanged and
sharpened: identify σ_obs independently (Spec B, daily-within-week noise floor) and make the head
bands robust (hierarchical/entity-level σ_obs; pool the 1–2-entity top knots).

**Reproduction:**
```
python llm_fitting/minimal_rankdiff.py reddit --top-k 5000            # or --coverage 90
python llm_fitting/minimal_rankdiff.py reddit --top-k 5000 --buffer-mult 8   # invariance check
python llm_fitting/rankdiff_kalman.py reddit --oos --top-k 5000       # OOS gate, train-only membership
python llm_fitting/minimal_rankdiff.py facebook --top-k 3500          # FB symmetric protocol
```

## 3. The three corrected estimation pitfalls (do not regress)

1. **Band-alignment bug (fixed, committed):** `mean_rank` is sorted but entity columns were not —
   rank-band masks selected the wrong entities, flattening all rank curves. Fixed via `mean_rank_ids`;
   locked by `tests/test_rankdiff_regressions.py`. (FB 15/15→14/15 on the v4.3 model after the fix —
   the drop was real, the bug had hidden it.)
2. **Current-rank (Eulerian) estimation is selection-biased:** conditioning on current rank
   oversamples transient spikers → inflates σ ~3× → runaway diffusion. **Always estimate by
   permanent (time-averaged) rank.**
3. **Observed-week mean rank re-admits the same bias at the universe-membership stage** (2026-07-02):
   compute permanent rank over ALL window periods with absent weeks at the observation floor
   (N_t+1). Locked by `tests/test_universe_restriction.py` (ghost-spiker exclusion).

## 4. Known limitations / open items
- **σ_obs identification** is THE crux. Calibrated for now; identify organically next (daily-within-week
  variance — but note the daily model needs heavy DoW/ToD damping; or replicate measures once Reddit
  comment data is merged — current `metric_value` = submission_karma only).
  _2026-07-02:_ Reddit's train calibration now selects scale **0.0** on every split and STILL
  over-predicts held-out displacement — the excess head dispersion is in the variance partition,
  not just the noise split. Spec B plus robust head bands (pool 1–2-entity top knots) is the path.
- **Reddit** OOS movement not fully passing (short panel: train windows are only 12–17 weeks).
  Now RUNNABLE and in FB's regime under the top-coverage universe (§2b). Needs the longer panel.
- **In-sample RACF vs OOS displacement tension:** more σ_obs helps in-sample rank-autocorrelation,
  less σ_obs helps OOS displacement. Real fit tension; report both.
- **Instagram = negative control, do NOT calibrate to it** ("a"-query censoring flattens its
  distribution → pathological rank displacement, R² collapse).

## 6. Framing for the paper
> Digital-attention rankings show **Eulerian stability with Lagrangian churn**: the rank-size curve and
> the per-rank share are stationary while identities churn through fixed ranks. A successful model must
> reproduce (i) the stationary ladder, (ii) fixed-rank occupant turnover, and (iii) **held-out** individual
> displacement. We combine a rank-based diffusion with Gabaix rebirth for the ladder and a state-space
> observation model (permanent + transitory + measurement) for the dynamics, unified across platforms
> with parameters that differ by regime, and we validate movement out-of-sample.
